## ECS Continuous Deployment (CD) Pipeline

This section describes the Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for deploying our containerized application to **Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** using **Fargate**.

### Overview

Our ECS CD pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying containerized applications to AWS ECS with Fargate. The pipeline is fully integrated with **GitHub Actions**, which handles the following steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**: A Docker image is built from the code in the repository using a `Dockerfile` and tagged with the appropriate version.
2. **Push to Amazon ECR**: The built Docker image is pushed to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), a managed Docker container registry.
3. **Update ECS Task Definition**: The ECS task definition is automatically updated with the new Docker image to deploy the latest version of the application.
4. **Deploy to ECS**: The new image is deployed to **AWS Fargate**, which runs the containerized application on-demand.

### Workflow Steps

1. **Code Push**: When code is pushed to the repository, a GitHub Action workflow is triggered.
   
2. **Docker Image Build**:
    - The workflow builds the Docker image using the `Dockerfile` located in the repository.
    - The image is tagged with the latest commit hash to uniquely identify the version.
   
3. **Push to ECR**:
    - After building the Docker image, it is pushed to the Amazon ECR repository.
    - The `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION` are used to authenticate and authorize the push to ECR.
   
4. **Update ECS Task Definition**:
    - The ECS task definition is updated with the new image URL from ECR.
    - The task definition contains container configuration details, such as resource allocation, networking, and port mappings.
   
5. **Deploy to Fargate**:
    - Once the ECS task definition is updated, the service running on ECS is automatically updated to use the new task definition, causing ECS to deploy the new image.
    - Fargate ensures the containers run without managing EC2 instances.
   
6. **Access the Application**:
    - After deployment, the application is accessible through a public IP or load balancer, depending on how the ECS service is configured (e.g., with an Application Load Balancer).

### GitHub Actions Configuration

The GitHub Actions workflow is configured to automatically run the following:

1. **Build Docker Image**: Build the Docker image from the `Dockerfile`.
2. **Push to ECR**: Push the built image to the Amazon ECR repository.
3. **Deploy to ECS**: Update the ECS task definition and deploy the new image to the ECS service.

### Benefits of ECS and Fargate

- **Serverless Infrastructure:** With Fargate, there is no need to manage EC2 instances. AWS automatically provisions and manages the compute resources for you.
- **Scalability:** ECS with Fargate scales automatically based on the number of tasks running, so you donâ€™t need to worry about scaling the infrastructure.
- **Cost Efficiency:** You only pay for the vCPU and memory used by your containers, reducing costs compared to running EC2 instances continuously.
- **Simplified Deployment:** The pipeline automates the deployment process, ensuring that the latest changes are always deployed with minimal effort.
